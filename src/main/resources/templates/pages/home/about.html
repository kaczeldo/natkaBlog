            Welcome, I'm Natalia.
            A yogini, traveler, and seeker of the deeper threads that weave life together. Spirituality has been
            part of my path since childhood, though like many of us, I lost touch with it for a time. It was
            through movement, dance, and yoga that I found my way back to myself—more grounded, open, and alive
            than ever.

        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I feel called to share what I've learned along the way:
            the insights gathered through travels, immersive trainings across Europe and Asia, and the quiet
            teachings of life itself. My intention is to guide and support others in finding balance, presence,
            and a deeper connection to themselves in this beautiful, but sometimes overwhelming world.

        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently based in Mallorca, offering both group and private classes.

        </p>
        <p>
            I'd love to meet you on the mat.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe the soul speaks through stillness—and yoga is how we listen.
